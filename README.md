# LeetCode
 LeetCode Problems & Solutions in Java

## Goal
The idea of this project is to be used as a training/preparation for Software Engineer Coding Interviews.

## Structure

The main code is structure in three main folders:
* Easy
* Medium
* Hard

For each of these folders we will have all the problems already resolved, in some cases with more than one approach.

Each solution is including Time and Space complexity in Big O notation.
